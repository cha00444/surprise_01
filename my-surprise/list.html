    <h1>🤍 10 Things I Love About You</h1>
    <p>baby, you know i have tons of things i love about you. but just so you have an idea, here’s 10 of them 🤍</p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Your smile</b> – when you smile and you’re genuinely happy, i love how it reaches your eyes. i love how i feel every time i look at the curve of your lips, the shine in your eyes. every single time, it never fails to bring a smile to my face too. Even if it’s just in a picture :))</li>

      <li><b>Your laugh</b> – ohh how i love your laughs, baby. the sounds you make, the little giggles… they’re one of the best things in this world. i will never get tired of hearing them :))</li>

      <li><b>The goofy faces you make</b> – i love it when you do that. you’re so so so freakin’ cute. no matter how hard you try to look funny, it’s even funnier because you don’t seem to realize how adorable you look :D</li>

      <li><b>Your eyes</b> – damn those eyes. you can undo me with just one look. they’re so expressive, my love, and i would willingly get lost in them every single time. my very own galaxies ✨</li>

      <li><b>Your voice</b> – always so soothing. even just your speaking voice is lovely :)) it’s always been one of my turn ons. and when you sing? don’t even get me started 😩 i feel so damn lucky to hear it often, even from just your vms.</li>

      <li><b>Your mind</b> – i love how it works :)) how thoughtful it is, how it understands things, how you always seem to know just what to say.</li>

      <li><b>Your thoughtfulness</b> – how sensitive you are with the people around you. how respectful you are, especially to elders, i love it :)) i love how you are with my parents, honestly. and with yours too.</li>

      <li><b>The way you love the people who matter to you</b> – i may not always see it firsthand, but i know how much care and love you give to your family. especially to those two kiddos, diego and nina :)) i adore how you are as their big sister.</li>

      <li><b>How strong you are</b> – you probably don’t even realize it, but you are, baby 🥺 you’re so strong and i’m so so proud of you. i love how, despite everything, you still wake up each day to face life. that’s not just something, that’s everything.</li>

      <li><b>Your heart</b> – oh god, your heart. how lucky am I to be even loved by it? you have such a beautiful heart, my love 🤍 it’s what makes you, you. and I promise to do my best to protect it.</li>
