    <h1>💌 To My Person</h1>
    <p>
      Hi baby,  
    </p>
    <p>
        happy first monthsary!! 🤍 even now, i still can’t believe that you’re mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      i never even thought it was possible for me to love someone to this extent. 
      i love you in every way, baby. not just your best, but also your fears, your scars, 
      the way you overthink, the pain you sometimes try so hard to hide, and the way you keep going despite it all. 
      and i want you to know that i am so so proud of you for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      thank you for your patience, your understanding, your care, your calm, your warmth, your love. 
      for everything you’ve given me and everything you are. thank you for being my person.
    </p>
    <p>
      i can’t promise to be perfect. i can’t even promise i’ll never hurt you. but what i can promise is that 
      i’ll never do so intentionally. i promise, as your partner, to always be patient with you, to be as 
      gentle as you need me to be, to make sure you always feel loved, wanted, enough, and cherished. 
      and i promise to protect not just your heart, but your peace and your silence too.
    </p>
    <p>
        and even though we're far apart right now, i want you to know that i feel you with me every single day,
        and i'm so looking forward to the day when i can finally hold you in my arms. until then, every message,
        every laugh, smile, and kilig we share through the screen means the world to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      i love you so, so much, kitten. you're my whole heart. happy monthsary! xoxo
